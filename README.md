#### Project Description:
Kellogg Deals is a site where Kellogg students can come to see the deals that other fellow students submitted once they are logged in. Logged in users will also have an option to add a deal of their own that they find on the internet so others in the community can benefit from the information as well. Deals can be "liked" if someone feels like it was a very good deal.
